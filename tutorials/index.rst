Welcome to Moveit Example Apps Tutorial
======================================

MoveIt Example Apps delivers advanced applications developed on `MoveIt <https://moveit.ros.org/>`_ for industrial robot.
These applications demonstrate typical usage scenarios of MoveIt and its extensible capabilities.
Aligning with the MoveIt framework makes the applications more hardware independent
and easier to be ported onto various robot devices (robot arms, end-effectors and sensors).

You can find these applications in the following list. If you would like to contribute a new application,
please consider using the template :doc:`[App Tutorial Template] <./doc/template>` to create the tutorial.
